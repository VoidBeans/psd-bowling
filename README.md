Bowling game layouts are presented as follows:

<pre>
I I I I      
 I I I       
  I I        
   I         
</pre>

Each pin is represented by an integer:

<pre>
7 8 9 10
 4 5 6 
  2 3
   1
</pre>

An array of integers are provided which represents pins that have been struck.

**EXAMPLE**

Given array: [3, 5, 9]

Resulting bowling pin layout:

<pre>
I I   I      
 I   I       
  I          
   I   
</pre>

The following rules are applied for the implementation:

* Lines are started with a newline (`\n`).
* Each line is 7 characters long.
* Missing pins are represented with a whitespace.
